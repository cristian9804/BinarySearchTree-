# BinarySearchTree-

This function prints the elements of the tree t in the following manner. At each node of the tree, it first prints all nodes of the subtree under the nodeâ€™s left child, then it prints (the data of) the node itself, and then the nodes of the right subtree.

Note: inorder is essentially depth-first search, only that we do not look at a node as soon as we get to it, but only after we have looked at all the nodes in the subtree that is under its left child.
